What is the safe withdrawal rate (SWR)? 

Assuming you have E equity invested in the S&P 500 index fund and a withdrawal
rate of W when you start your retirement at year 0:  
To cover next year's expenses, you withdraw  
&emsp;E W  
The remaining equity at the end of year 0 is  
&emsp;e<sub>0</sub> = E - E W  

If annual return for year 1 is r<sub>1</sub>, then at the end of year 1,
the equity becomes  
&emsp;e<sub>0</sub> (1+r<sub>1</sub>)  
To adjust for year 1's inflation i<sub>1</sub>, now you withdraw  
&emsp;E W (1+i<sub>1</sub>)  
to cover next year's expenses. The remaining equity at the end of year 1 is  
&emsp;e<sub>1</sub> = e<sub>0</sub> (1+r<sub>1</sub>) - E W (1+i<sub>1</sub>)   

If annual return for year 2 is r<sub>2</sub>, then at the end of year 2,
the equity becomes  
&emsp;e<sub>1</sub> (1+r<sub>2</sub>)  
After withdrawal for next year's expenses, the remaining equity at the end of
year 2 is  
&emsp;e<sub>2</sub> = e<sub>1</sub> (1+r<sub>2</sub>) - E W (1+i<sub>1</sub>) (1+i<sub>2</sub>)  
And so on.

In general, after withdrawal for next year's expenses, the remaining equity
at the end of year n is  
&emsp;e<sub>n</sub> = e<sub>n-1</sub> (1+r<sub>n</sub>) - E W (1+i<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+i<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;= e<sub>0</sub> (1+r<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- E W (1+i<sub>1</sub>) (1+r<sub>2</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- E W (1+i<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+i<sub>m</sub>) (1+r<sub>m+1</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- E W (1+i<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+i<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;= E [&emsp;&emsp;(1+r<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- W (1+r<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- W (1+i<sub>1</sub>) (1+r<sub>2</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- W (1+i<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+i<sub>m</sub>) (1+r<sub>m+1</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- W (1+i<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+i<sub>n</sub>)&emsp;]  

Safe withdrawal rate is the initial withdrawal rate to use such that at the
end of year n, the remaining equity runs out (i.e. e<sub>n</sub> = 0). Since
the next year's expenses are already covered at this time, the initial equity
E actually lasted n+1 years. (note: the safe withdrawal rate does not really
depend on the initial equity amount E.)

&emsp;SWR = (1+r<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>) /  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[&emsp;&emsp;(1+r<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;+ (1+i<sub>1</sub>) (1+r<sub>2</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;+ ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;+ (1+i<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+i<sub>m</sub>) (1+r<sub>m+1</sub>) ... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;+ ...  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;+ (1+i<sub>1</sub>) ... (1+i<sub>n</sub>)&emsp;]
